# Tensorflow Linear Regression

Tensorflow implementation for Linear Regression.

# OverView
This is the code for a single variable linear regression, that is optimising the mean squared error using SGD(Stochastic Gradient Descent).
You can find the demo at  (https://tensorflow-linear-regression.herokuapp.com/)

# Demo Parts

## Training:
As we are using a variant of gradient descent, in the training part of the demo you can provide the training data the learning rate and the amount epochs.
